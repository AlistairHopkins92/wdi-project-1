#My first project for WDI London - The box game

### Introduction:

‘Fill Me In’ is a two player puzzle game from my childhood traditionally played with pen and paper. Each player takes it in turn to draw a line between the dots. If a player creates a square, the square is filled the players colour then the player gets another go. The game is over when all possible lines have been drawn, and all squares have been shaded. The winner is the player with the most squares of their colour.

‘Fill Me In’ was built as my first project during the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly London. The project was presented on the Friday of week two and to be presented on the Tuesday of week three. The game was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### How to play:

The game starts with a grid of dots, players take it in turns to draw lines between the dots. One a basic square has been completed the square will turn to the players colour and player will get a point. After a square has been completed the player who completes it gets another go. The game ends when all the lines have been filled, the winner is the player who has completed the most boxes.
