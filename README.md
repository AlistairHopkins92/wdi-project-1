#My first project for WDI London - The box game

### Introduction:

The box game is a two player puzzle game from my childhood traditionally played with pen and paper. It was built as a first Javascript project during my time on the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly London.


### How to play:

The game starts with an empty grid with dots showing the corner positions of the squares. Players take it in turns to draw lines between theses dots. One a basic square has been completed the square will turn to the players colour and player will get a point. After a square has been completed the player who completes it gets another go. The game ends when all the lines have been filled, the winner is the player who has completed the most boxes.


###The Project requirements:

+ Display a game in the browser.
+ The game should be playable by two players or consist of a series of levels if one player.
+ The project should not use dedicated library for game making.


###Technologies:

The box game is built with HTML/CSS and Javascript, it used the following librairies:
+ jQuery
+ soundJS
+ animate.css
